## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to overlay an image onto an ArUco marker detected in another image using OpenCV. The overlay image is resized, transformed, and blended with the original image to align with the perspective of the detected ArUco marker.

## Features
- Detect ArUco markers in an image.
- Resize and overlay an image onto the detected marker.
- Perspective transformation to match the overlay with the marker's perspective.
- Blending the overlay image seamlessly onto the original image.

## Installation
Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd aruco-marker-overlay
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy
    ```

## Usage
Replace `"path_to_overlay_image"` and `"path_to_image"` in the script with the actual paths to your images. Then, run the script:

```bash
python script_name.py

## Configuration
image2 = cv2.imread("path_to_overlay_image", cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED)
scale_percent = 30
